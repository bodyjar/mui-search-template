                        The best all-around camera we've ever put into a Nexus shines in low-light conditions. Its larger 1.55μm pixels capture more light even in the dimmest conditions to produce stunning details and sharp images. With a faster Google Camera app, you'll never miss a moment, and with the smart Google Photos app, your memories are easy to relive and always at your fingertips.
